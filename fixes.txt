- Calculus.js:diff:453
  clone the temp var when diffing sqrt because there was a bug related to mutating code

- Algebra.js:Polynomial.parse:115
  also parse into a `cs` array that contains symbolic coefficients (the existing `c` couldn't parse things like sqrt)
- Algebra.js:coeffs:1955
  create a new API `coeffsV2` function to use Polynomial.coeffsSym instead

- Algebra.js:_factor:2450
  change `core.Utils.evaluate` to `_.parse` to avoid the PARSE2NUMBER wrapping for the `factor` method

- nerdamer.core.js:9550
  add `minisculeRound` method for ad-hoc decimal points rounding utility
- nerdamer.core.js:pow:9630
  when nthroot-ing negative numbers. Fix the bug of not nthroot-ing the modulo. Also use `minisculeRound` to mainly discard miniscule calculation offsets (usually becoming 0)

- nerdamer.core.js:abs:7270
  add some logic to check that if the symbol is a `abs` or `sqrt` function, just return the symbol as they're already non-negative

- nerdamer.core.js:12455
  add `libExports.pure` to call functions without having to go through the PARSE2NUMBER block

- nerdamder.core.js:value:10540
  add option to use space for latex multiplication instead of dot
- nerdamder.core.js:set:10580
  add option to use space for latex multiplication instead of dot, also an option to display standalone fraction

- nerdamder.core.js:3766
  add a `isConstantV2` method to symbol to avoid touching `isConstant` (the code there is too messy and even inaccurate)
    first usage was for parsing polynomial (checking if a term is a constant)

- Algebra.js:coeffFactor:2811
  add `symbol.updateHash()` after some inner symbols manipulation (for extracting -1 out of greatest term)

- Algebra.js:mSqfrFactor:2970
  if the derivative is an exponential then quit, since the exponential can be repeatedly derived
  fix checking dividend and quotient (or else they're the same and will always be equal)
- Algebra.js:div:3563
  add `symbol.updateHash()` after multiplier mutation (affecting the equality check of dividend and quotient above)

- Algebra.js:sqdiff:2970
  Add logic to allow more variation of square diffing and correctly handle signs

- nerdamder.core.js:multiply
  fix a symbol to retain it's sign after it's multiplier is extracted out

- Algebra.js:Polynomial:50
  fix polynomial parsing to allow setting custom variable (in the case of multi-variable)

- Algebra.js:1984
  add `polyTex` function to render latex specifically for polynomial (grouping by degree)
